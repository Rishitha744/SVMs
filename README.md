## 📘 Overview
This repository contains implementations of:
- **Regularized Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** with Linear, Polynomial, and RBF kernels  
- A **comparison of model performance** on two benchmark datasets:
  - Breast Cancer
  - Sonar

The goal is to evaluate how linear and nonlinear classifiers perform on different types of data.
